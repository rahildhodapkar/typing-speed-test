### Description
This is a project from my time in the Blueprint Fellowship program at Rutgers - New Brunswick, a three month long intensive program aimed at teaching students the basic of web development. My group and I decided on making a simple typing test. As of right now, the application starts a timer the moment you enter your first character into the text area, and the test concludes when the number of characters you have inputted matches the number of characters of the words you are being tested on. In the future, I would like to make the test more accurate by having the application keep track of each individual character one has typed whilst they are typing, and dynamically showing the difference between the typed words and the test words. 

### Usage 
Ensure that you have downloaded [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rahildhodapkar/typing-speed-test
```
2. Navigate to the repository's directory and run the command
```sh
npm install
```
3. Start the application using
```sh
npm start
```
4. You can now access the application at http://localhost:3000

### Technologies
This is a React based project that calls the [Random Word API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home), utilizing asynchronouse functions to fetch random words from the API.
